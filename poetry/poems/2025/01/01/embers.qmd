## Embers

We are the children of fire,
born in the smoke of burning villages,
raised in the dust of a thousand footsteps
walking away from everything we knew.

They said we would forget.
They said the new land would wash us clean,
bleach the memories from our skin,
teach us to speak in foreign tongues
until our mother's voice became a stranger.

But fire does not forget.
Fire remembers the wood it consumed,
the forests it transformed,
the darkness it held at bay
through all the long and starless nights.

We carry embers in our chests —
small, glowing coals that pulse
with each beat of our displaced hearts.
They cannot be extinguished
by oceans crossed or borders closed
or documents that spell our names wrong.

The fire knows our true names.
The fire sings them in the old language,
the one we speak in dreams,
the one that rises unbidden
when we smell cooking smoke
or hear drums in the distance.

We are the living dead,
walking between two worlds,
carrying our ancestors in our marrow,
our homeland in our blood.

We are the fire carriers,
and though they scattered our ashes
across a hundred refugee camps,
a thousand foreign cities,
ten thousand cold apartments
where no one knows our stories —

The embers still glow.
The embers remember.
The embers wait
for the breath that will make them
blaze again.

*We do not die. We transform.*
*We do not forget. We become.*
