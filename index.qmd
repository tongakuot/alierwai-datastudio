# Reflecting on the Past to Illuminate the Future

In 1996, after triumphantly passing the Kenyan Certificate of Primary Examination (KCPE), my friends and I seized a memorable moment at the home of Mwalimu Benson Chege Njuguna in Kakuma town.
We immortalized the event with a photograph, encapsulating our educational accomplishments and the nurturing environment that fostered our growth.

During our time in Kakuma refugee camp, we were characterized by an unyielding drive to succeed, fueled by a fiery passion that ignited our spirits.
Despite numerous adversities, we pursued academic excellence, devoting ourselves wholeheartedly to our studies.
Through tenacity and persistence, we defied the odds and actualized our aspirations.

Our journey stands as a testament to the transformative potential of passion and commitment.
We discovered that true success transcends mere physical sustenance; it entails nurturing the soul with a steadfast spirit and unwavering focus.
This invaluable lesson has accompanied us throughout our lives, motivating us to consistently strive for greater achievements and inspire others to follow suit.

Honoring our heritage and expressing gratitude for our blessings can take many forms, but one of the most meaningful ways to do so is by maintaining a resolute focus on our goals while extending compassion and aid to those in need.
By directing our energies toward constructive pursuits and supporting others, we not only honor our past but also contribute to the growth and well-being of our communities.
