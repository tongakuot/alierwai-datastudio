## The Fire Within

In the refugee camps of East Africa, stories were our survival. They traveled with us across borders, through loss and displacement, carrying the voices of those who could no longer speak. These writings are an act of resurrection — bringing back to life the memories, the people, and the places that shaped us.

**The Living Dead** is not about death. It is about the persistence of memory, the refusal to be forgotten, and the transformative power of storytelling. Every word is a ember from the fire that forged us.
