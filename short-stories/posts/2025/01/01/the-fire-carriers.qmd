## Part One: The Embers

The fire had gone out three times before Deng finally got it to hold. He was twelve years old, and this was the first fire he had built alone since his father disappeared into the bush with the other men, marching toward a war that had no end and no beginning that anyone could remember.

"You must learn to carry the fire," his grandmother had told him the night before they fled. "Not just in your hands, but in your heart. The fire is memory. The fire is who we are."

He hadn't understood then. He understood now.

In Kakuma, everything was the color of dust. The tents, the people, the sky at midday when the sun hung overhead like an accusation. Only the fires had color — the orange and gold of cooking flames, the red embers that glowed through the night, the blue heart of a fire properly built.

Deng became known as the boy who could start a fire from nothing. Other children would come to him with their cold pots and their shivering grandmothers, and he would kneel in the dust and coax flames from wood that should not burn.

"How do you do it?" they would ask.

"I remember," he would say, though he could not explain what he meant.

## Part Two: The Gathering

Years passed. The camp grew. The children who had come as infants took their first steps in Kakuma dust, learned their first words in a mixture of Dinka and Swahili and English, dreamed their first dreams under canvas skies.

Deng was no longer a boy. He was a young man who had somehow survived — the fevers, the fighting, the long nights when hope seemed as distant as South Sudan. He had survived, and he had kept the fire burning.

One evening, as the sun painted the camp in shades of amber and rose, an old woman approached his fire. Her eyes were clouded with age, but her voice was clear.

"You are the fire carrier," she said. It was not a question.

"I am Deng. I build fires."

She shook her head slowly. "You carry them. There is a difference." She sat down beside him, her bones creaking like old wood. "I have been watching you for many seasons. You have the gift of the ancestors."

"I have no gift. I have matches and dry wood."

The old woman laughed, a sound like wind through grass. "The fire was here before matches. The fire was here before wood. The fire is in us, waiting to be remembered."

## Part Three: The Passing

The old woman came every evening after that. She would sit by Deng's fire and tell him stories — stories of the old days, before the war, before the camps, when the Dinka moved with their cattle across lands that knew no borders. She told him of the fire ceremonies, of the sacred flames that had burned for generations, of the fire carriers who kept the memory of the people alive.

"We are the living dead," she told him one night. "All of us who have lost our land, our families, our old lives. We died when we crossed that border. But we were born again in the fire of memory."

"I don't understand."

"You will." She reached out and touched his chest, over his heart. "The fire is here. It has always been here. You just need to remember how to let it out."

That night, she did not come to his fire. In the morning, they found her in her tent, still and peaceful, a slight smile on her face.

Deng built her funeral pyre himself. As the flames rose, he felt something shift inside him — a heat, a light, a presence that was both foreign and familiar.

The fire carriers, he understood at last, never truly die. They pass their flames to the next generation, and the next, and the next, an unbroken chain of light stretching back to the beginning of memory and forward to its end.

He was a fire carrier now. And he had work to do.
