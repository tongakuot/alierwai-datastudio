## Chapter One: The Last Night

The stars were different in South Sudan.

Achol would remember this later, in the camp, when she looked up at the Kenyan sky and felt something was wrong before she could name it. The constellations were the same — Orion still hunted across the darkness, the Southern Cross still pointed the way — but something had shifted. The stars seemed farther away, smaller, dimmer. As if they, too, had lost their home.

But on that last night in her village, the stars blazed.

She was eleven years old, though she would lose track of her age in the years that followed. The war had been a distant thunder for as long as she could remember, a sound on the horizon that the adults discussed in worried whispers. Sometimes the thunder came closer, and families would pack their belongings and disappear into the night. Sometimes it receded, and life would continue — the cattle would graze, the crops would grow, the children would play in the river.

That night, the thunder arrived.

"Achol. Wake up."

Her mother's voice was calm, but there was something beneath the calm that made Achol sit up immediately. The hut was dark, the cooking fire reduced to embers.

"What is it, Mama?"

"We have to go. Now. Don't speak. Just follow."

Achol had practiced this. All the children had. They knew to grab their shoes (if they had shoes), to take nothing else, to move quickly and quietly through the darkness. They knew not to ask questions. They knew that questions could get you killed.

Outside, the village was a ghost of itself. Shadows moved between huts — families gathering, children being lifted, the elderly being helped along. No one spoke. The only sounds were footsteps on packed earth and the distant crackling that Achol would later understand was fire.

"Where is Baba?" she whispered.

Her mother's hand tightened on hers. "He will find us. Keep walking."

They walked for seven days.

Later, Achol would not be able to remember them all. They blurred together into a single endless motion — one foot in front of the other, the sun rising and falling like a fever, the stars wheeling overhead in their strange new configurations. She remembered thirst. She remembered her baby brother's crying, and then his silence, which was worse. She remembered the bodies they passed, and how quickly she learned not to look at them.

On the fourth day — or was it the fifth? — they crossed a river.

The water was brown and swift and came up to Achol's chest. Her mother held the baby above her head, walking slowly, feeling for each foothold. Achol clung to her mother's dress and focused on not being swept away. Around them, others were crossing too — a long line of desperate humanity, leaving everything behind, carrying only what they could hold.

A woman near them stumbled. Achol heard the splash, the cry cut short. She did not look back.

On the other side, they lay on the bank and breathed. Achol's mother held her close and whispered prayers into her hair. The baby was silent in his wrap, his eyes wide and watching.

"This is the border," her mother said. "We are in Kenya now. We are safe."

But safety, Achol would learn, was just another kind of lie adults told children. Safety was a word for a world that no longer existed.
