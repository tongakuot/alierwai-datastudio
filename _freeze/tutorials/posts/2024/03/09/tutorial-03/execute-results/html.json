however, I am more comfortable with the ggplot2).\n\n# Getting Started\n\n## Loading the Required Libraries\n\nIn this tutorial, I will load two packages - `tidyverse` and `ggtext`.\nLater, in the visualization section, I will use the `ggthemes` package and call it directly since I need a single theme to enhance my plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Libraries ------\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Data Wrangling and Visualization\n\n## Cleaning and Transforming data\n\n### Importing the Dataset\n\nIn this section, I will use the link from **Matt Harrison's** post to load the **Kyoto Full Flower 7** dataset.\nAfter loading the data, I will write a function to clean and transform it and demonstrate how to write a function in `R`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the dataset\ncherry_raw <-\n  readxl::read_excel(\n    \"KyotoFullFlower7.xls\",\n    skip = 25\n  ) |>\n  janitor::clean_names() |>\n  select(\n    year = ad,\n    flowering_day_of_year = full_flowering_date_doy,\n    flowering_month = full_flowering_date\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    date = str_c(year,\n      str_sub(flowering_month, 1, 1),\n      str_sub(flowering_month, 2, 3),\n      sep = \"-\"\n    )\n  ) |>\n  filter(!is.na(date)) |>\n  mutate(\n    rolling_day_of_year = slider::slide_dbl(\n      flowering_day_of_year,\n      mean,\n      .before = 20,\n      .complete = TRUE\n    )\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the code snippet above, I used the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package to read the **KyotoFullFlower7.xls** dataset.\nI then skipped the first **25** rows with the `skip()` argument, converted column names to `snakecase` using the `clean_names()` function from the `janitor` package, and selected and renamed the columns of interest with the `select()` function from the `dplyr` package.\n\nAfter that, I created a new column named \"date\" by combining the year with the month and day portions of the \"flowering_month\" column.\nI used the `str_c()` and `str_sub()` functions from the `stringr` package for this purpose.\nThe new column values were separated by a hyphen (\"-\") to look like \"year-month-day,\" for example, \"815-4-15\".\nThen, I removed missing or NA values from the new date column using the `filter()` function from the dplyr package.\n\nFinally, I calculated the mean \"rolling_day_of_year\" with the `slide_dbl()` function from the `slider` package.\nI used a *20-year window* and the values were calculated from the **flowering_day_of_year**.\n\n### Writing a Function\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define a function for cleaning and transforming dataset\ntweak_cherry_trees_data <- function(data,\n                                    window,\n                                    cols) {\n  data |>\n    janitor::clean_names() |>\n    select({{ cols }}) |>\n    mutate(\n      date = str_c(year,\n        str_sub(flowering_month, 1, 1),\n        str_sub(flowering_month, 2, 3),\n        sep = \"-\"\n      )\n    ) |>\n    filter(!is.na(date)) |>\n    mutate(\n      rolling_day_of_year = slider::slide_dbl(\n        flowering_day_of_year,\n        mean,\n        .before = {{ window }},\n        .complete = TRUE\n      )\n    )\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the above code snippet, I wrote a data cleaning and transformation function using the code in the preceding section.\nI will not dive deep into the mechanics of function writing in R in this section; those interested can read more about [R function writing here.](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions \"R for Data Science, 2nd edition\")\n\n### Testing the Function\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Let's test our new function\ncherry_trees_raw <-\n  readxl::read_excel(\n    \"KyotoFullFlower7.xls\",\n    skip = 25\n  )\n\n# Clean and transform the data\ncherry_trees_data_tbl <-\n  tweak_cherry_trees_data(\n    cherry_trees_raw,\n    cols = c(\n      year = ad,\n      flowering_day_of_year = full_flowering_date_doy,\n      flowering_month = full_flowering_date\n    ),\n    window = 20\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nMy new function worked well, and I can now use it to update my analysis of the cherry trees blossoming in Kyoto whenever necessary.\n\n## Plotting Cherry Trees Data\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot cherry trees data ------\ncherry_trees_data_tbl |>\n  ggplot(aes(year, flowering_day_of_year)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE, size = 0.8) +\n  geom_line(\n  \taes(y = rolling_day_of_year),\n    na.rm = TRUE,\n    linewidth = 1.2,\n    color = \"#5e2ce8\"\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    \"text\",\n    x = 1990,\n    y = 90,\n    label = \"20-Year\\n Average\",\n    color = \"#5e2ce8\",\n    size = 8,\n    na.rm = TRUE\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    limits = c(812, 2015),\n    breaks = c(812, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2023)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    limits = c(70, 120),\n    labels = c(\n      \"March 11\", \"March 21\", \"March 31\",\n      \"April 10\", \"April 20\", \"April 30\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  ggthemes::theme_wsj() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Cherry trees have been blossoming earlier due to warmer spring temperatures\",\n    subtitle = \"Date of peak cherry tree (***Prunus jamasakura***) in Kyoto, Japan\",\n    caption = \"**Data Source: Yasuk Aono (2021:2024)**<br>**Note:** The <span style='color: #5e2ce8'>20-year average</span> is calculated when there are at least five years with data in the <span style='color: #5e2ce8'>20-year window</span>.
